## Project Overview

This project includes multiple websites, each designed to highlight different aspects of web development with JavaScript and Python. The websites will cover a range of functionalities, including dynamic content, API integration, and server-side processing.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For client-side scripting, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous operations.
- **Python**: For server-side scripting, API development, and backend logic.
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for Python.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and pre-built components.

Each site has its own directory containing the necessary files for its functionality. The `static` folder holds CSS and JavaScript files, while the `templates` folder contains HTML files. The `app.py` file is the main entry point for the Flask application.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Web-Dev.git
   cd Web-Dev

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To run any of the websites, navigate to its directory and start the Flask server:

cd site1
python app.py

Then, open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view the website.
